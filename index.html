                    <p>It is my birthplace, Bangladesh, which has the world's biggest river delta. Cultural diversity abounds in Bangladesh. There are many ways to observe the countries deeply engrained cultural heritage, including its architecture, dancing, literature, music, painting, and dress. Besides Bangla, I can speak English, a little bit of Spanish. Currently, I am in the process of completing a bachelor's degree in information technology. Having found my passion in video games, I have named it my hobby. Besides relieving my stress, playing video games helps me relax after a hard day at work or school. What's better than finding your hobby is something that accelerates your desire for being the most accomplished through something that almost 50% of my readers like doing “Gaming”. I am Adventurous.  Despite not knowing what the outcome will be, I am prepared to go ahead and do things.</p>

                <div class="text" style="text-align:center">My Project Idea</div>
                <p>The notion of creating an app depends on my knowledge of the coding required and the caliber of the app I hope to create. I would like to make a meme app. Who doesn't enjoy GIFs and memes? They have dominated the social media video genre and are catching on like wildfire. You must have seen a meme, but when you attempt to recall it, you have trouble. I want to create a meme app where people can share and watch the meme and see the precise consequences to prevent it from happening.
                <span id="dots">...</span><span id="more"><br><b>Motivation</b><br>
                    The idea was developed with the intention of assisting those affected by the covid epidemic. According to a study published in Psychology of Popular Media, people may find it easier to deal with the stress of the epidemic if they see funny COVID-19 memes. In December 2020, researchers questioned 748 online users how frequently they experienced anxiety the previous month. Then, participants were randomly allocated to view one of three different types of memes or a text-only control. A decrease in stress connected to the COVID-19 pandemic was indirectly associated with participants' better levels of humors and happy emotions when compared to the control group (Myrick, Nabi, and Eng, 2022).
                    <br><b>Description</b><br>
                    You may share memes with your friends using this project's meme app, which will provide semi-regular updates and allow you to browse and select from hundreds of famous memes. It will Offer gallery of images, get a live preview of the memes while creating, Quick sharing options and saving to SD card option, Easy to use. Enjoy anywhere and at any point of time. Easy sharing of the trendiest memes in Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, WhatsApp and more. Discuss any topic with this healthiest addiction and connect with millions. Get creative with meme-making. Because memes are entertaining and spreadable examples of cultural knowledge, I wish to create this app. They are therefore a quick and simple method of exchanging cultural knowledge. Therefore, every time you upload or share a meme, you are effectively disseminating digestible cultural knowledge to all of humanity.<br>
                    A straightforward and user-friendly user interface is the first and primary factor that I would consider when creating this app (UI). The user interface (UI), which encompasses a variety of elements such as content, media presentation, navigation, input control, etc., is how users will interact with an app. Whatever my target market may be, I will always aim to make sure that my app has a user interface (UI) that is straightforward and approachable so that anyone, whether they are 12 or 65, can easily browse and utilise it. My app will include a Customizable Privacy Settings feature that will let users manage who can view their profile, who can see the material they publish, how much of their information is made public, and other similar things. The information being exchanged across the network is something that users want to be able to manage.  I will include a content sharing option because it is one of the best features of social media platforms because it allows people to stay connected even if they live on two opposite poles of the earth. If you want your social media app to succeed, it must include a content-sharing option where users can post, share photos and videos, as well as the ability to comment on the content being shared No matter how innovative and amazing the in-app features are, if the app is not aesthetically appealing and the design is not user-friendly, the app will fail. I want to use distinct customisable skins throughout the app's pages to make it more appealing to consumers.<br>
                    <b>Tools and technologies</b><br>
                    I will choose whether I want the app to be native or hybrid as it is being developed. Hybrid applications combine online and native apps, making them cross-platform and able to access smartphone capabilities. Making hybrids would be a reasonable choice as the same HTML5 platform is used by web apps as well. The browser, which is part of the programme itself, is used to process them. Native Script, which provides a runtime, bridge module, and JS-based virtual machine, may be my go-to tool when it comes to developing hybrid apps. Each mobile OS platform may receive a native user experience thanks to this framework.<br>
                    <b>Skills Required</b><br>
                    The process of developing mobile apps entails several steps that involve programming and creating software or programs that are intended for quickly running portable devices like tablets and smart phones. Building a top-notch user interface is perhaps the most crucial part of developing a mobile app (UI). then being familiar with cross-platform development A talented application developer is not only knowledgeable and proficient in one platform's coding, but also adaptable enough to produce apps for any platform and any device. This opens the door to further opportunities and a brilliant developer profile. Additionally, there is back-end computing, which handles security, database administration, hardware interfacing, and memory allocation implementation. Knowledge of programming in contemporary programming languages is a crucial ability needed to create mobile applications. Furthermore, to outperform the competition, business capacity and knowledge are crucial.
                    <br><b>Outcome</b><br>
                    The first and most important benefit is that a specialized social networking mobile app will boost the reach of your business among the appropriate demographic. The likelihood that an app will be downloaded and utilized will grow, thus the more engaging it is, the better.
